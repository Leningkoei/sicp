;;; As a large system with generic operations evolves, new types of data objects
;;; or new operations may be needed. For each of the three strategies -- generic
;;; operations with explicit dispatch, data-directed style, and
;;; message-passing-style -- describe the changes that must be made to a system
;;; in order to add new types or new operations. Which organization would be
;;; most appropriate for a system in which new types must often be added? Which
;;; would be most appropriate for a system in which new operations must often be
;;; added?

;;; type: message-passing-style
;;; operation: data-directed-style (x) Both two do not fit.
