;;; Give a scenario where the deadlock-avoidance mechanism described above does
;;; not work. (Hint: In the exchange problem, each process knows in advance
;;; which accounts it will need to get access to. Consider a situation where a
;;; process must get access to some shared resources before it can know which
;;; additional shared resources it will require.)
